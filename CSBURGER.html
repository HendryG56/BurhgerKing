                <p class="newburger-body">
                    First of all, the buns from this burger are made from the best selection of ingredients from
                    Indonesia, precisely on the island of Sumatra. As for the meat, we've been doing research for the
                    last few years which finally succeeded in combining chicken and beef into 1 meat that has a very
                    rich taste. For vegetables such as tomatoes, lettuce, onions are the best choices of vegetables that
                    we get from the Netherlands which are imported fresh. This new burger we can guarantee that it is
                    one of the most unique burgers ever.
